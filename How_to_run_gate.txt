This doc shows how to run GATE locally and using IHEP cluster, the detailed setup for GATE simulation can be found directely in the running macrso.

1: run GATE in local cpu
1): the executive shell script is: run_gate_simulation_local.sh
  You need to set some parameters in it, including: 

   a): the time resolutin: TIME_RES
   b): your GATE macros path: PATH_GATE_MACRO;
   c): the simulation output name:  OUTPUT_NAME
   d): gamma photon number for each core:GAMMA_NUM     
   e): for Local running, the path is set as relative path, just for convinience.

2): different phantom and sources can be found in the ./phantom_source_lib 

3): The simulation results are saved in the ./results.

2: Run gate in the IHEP cluster
  1): the main executive is: ./ihep_cluster_multicore_job_pbs.sh where you need to set the CPU number you are about to use:CPU_NUM and the simulation log path where you running log is saved. 
  
  2): qsub can not use multithreads, so the actually running script is : ./ihep_cluster_singlecore_job_pbs.sh  which is called by 1).
      You need to set parameters including:
      a): the time resolutin: TIME_RES
      b): your GATE macros path: PATH_GATE_MACRO;
      c): the simulation output name:  OUTPUT_NAME
      d): gamma photon number for each core:GAMMA_NUM   
    note: all the paths should be the absolute path, not the relative path, otherwise you will be really miseralble.

  3) After you have set up all the parameters in your local computer, then you can copy it to the ihep cluster using the following commands:

  scp -rv * mabo@192.168.180.21:/data/simulation/home/mabo/software/src/gate/ihep_human_tof_pet_sz/

  4): submit your job: 
    source ihep_cluster_multicore_job_pbs.sh
  
  5): use qstat to check your job; 

  6): use qdel to stop your job; 

  7): After the simulation, copy the data back to your local desk using:
    scp -rv  mabo@192.168.180.21:/data/simulation/home/mabo/software/src/gate/ihep_human_tof_pet_sz/results/* ./

 8) Now everything is done, you can upload the results using IHEPBOX.
